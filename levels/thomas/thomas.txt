This is my first attempt to make a Jump&Bump level.
I was tired af all the "outdoors" arenas, so I tried to make
it look like a castle or something...the result's ok I guess,
it could need some more work, but at least it's playable and
the graphix are quite nice I think. The music was made in 2 min
in FT2. Look out for more levels from me in the future!
