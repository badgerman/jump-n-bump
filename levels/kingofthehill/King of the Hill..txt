This is my first attempt at a Jump & Bump level.
So all the graphics are stolen from the original.
I broke the scoreboard somehow?? if there is a 
way to fix this please let me know!
And there is no background.. because I'm lazy.:)


Anyway I thought it might be fun to play a king of the hill type game
with these rabbits o'death so here it is.  It probably plays best
with 3-4 players but it's fun as a 1v1 map too.  See who can stay
at the top of the hill the longest!!

I would like to fix all the problems with this map.

soo.. any comments/syuggestions: brew409@gci-net.com

thanks for trying my level!!
