Welcome to Mario Jump 'N' Bump. This is my second level now, my first was jump2.
Mario Jump 'N' Bump looks very similar to the original mario bros. on Nintendo. 
That was how I intended it. This addon may look simple but it is the best level I've
played yet. It has lots of room to move as well as lots of different places go. This dat file also
includes new music which I found on the internet. I hopped it would jazz thing up a little
