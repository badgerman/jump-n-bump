grid.pcx is a pcx of the 
16x22 grid of squares that 
the level is build around.  
It is great for early 
testing (just fill in the 
appropriate squares), and 
can be used to line up 
graphics correctly.  I 
thought that maybe you would
want to unzip this file and
have it availabe for separate
download, as it serves as a
great starting point for
a new level.
